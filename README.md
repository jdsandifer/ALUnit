# AutoLISP Unit (ALUnit)
A simple, fast unit testing framework for AutoLISP

This framework will follow the style of JUnit as much as possible, drawing from lisp-unit
for AutoLISP implementation ideas from Common Lisp.

Some goals for the project:
- Be able to run all tests with one command.
- Tests run quickly and display total elapsed time.
- Enough information is displayed about the results, but not too much.
- Low memory usage.
- The framework is properly unit tested itself. (After the first version is finished.)
